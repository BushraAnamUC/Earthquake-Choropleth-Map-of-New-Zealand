## Introduction
This project creates a **Choropleth Map** to visualise the frequency of earthquakes in various regions of New Zealand over the past year. Using geospatial data and Python libraries such as **GeoPandas** and **Folium**, we plot earthquake density as a color-coded map, highlighting regional variations in seismic activity.

---

## Objective
To provide a clear and interactive visual representation of earthquake occurrences in New Zealand, enabling researchers and stakeholders to identify patterns and trends in seismic activity.

---

## Why Folium?
**Folium** is a Python library that simplifies the creation of interactive maps. It supports multiple map types and integrates seamlessly with geospatial data formats like GeoJSON and Shapefiles. Folium allows:
- Creating interactive maps with zoom and pan functionality.
- Adding layers, legends, and tooltips for better interpretation.
- Generating HTML-based visualisations, making it easy to share insights.

This project showcases the power of Folium to visualsze earthquake frequency across New Zealand regions interactively.

## Dataset Information
1. **Earthquake Data:**
   - **Source:** GeoNet earthquake dataset.
   - **Format:** GeoJSON.
   - **Key Columns:** 
     - `latitude`: Latitude of the earthquake.
     - `longitude`: Longitude of the earthquake.
     - `depth`: Depth of the earthquake.
     - `magnitude`: Magnitude of the earthquake.

2. **Region Shapefile:**
   - **Source:** New Zealand territorial authority regions from Stats NZ.
   - **Format:** Shapefile (`.shp`).
   - **Projection:** NZGD2000 / New Zealand Transverse Mercator 2000 (EPSG:2193).

## Project Workflow

### Steps:
1. **Load and Prepare Data:**
   - Import earthquake GeoJSON data and region shapefiles.
   - Reproject shapefiles to EPSG:4326 (WGS 84) for consistency.

2. **Spatial Join:**
   - Assign earthquakes to regions using a spatial join.
   - Aggregate earthquake counts by region.

3. **Prepare GeoJSON for Visualization:**
   - Merge earthquake counts with shapefiles.
   - Fill missing data for regions with no earthquakes.
   - Save the cleaned GeoJSON file.

4. **Visualise Data:**
   - Create an interactive map centered on New Zealand.
   - Add a Choropleth layer to represent earthquake frequency.

5. **Export and Share:**
   - Save the Choropleth map as an HTML file for easy sharing.
